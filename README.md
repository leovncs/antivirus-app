<h4>1. Directory Scanning</h4>
<p>The program allows the user to select a directory, and from there, the system performs a recursive scan of files and subdirectories.</p>

<h4>2. File Detection</h4>
<p>The system can be configured to detect files with specific extensions or names. Detected files are logged for review.</p>

<h4>3. File Deletion</h4>
<p>After detecting files, the user can opt to delete all detected files. The program will prompt the user for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion.</p>

<h4>4. Real-time Logging</h4>
